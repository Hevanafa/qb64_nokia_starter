## About QBJS

If you plan to use **QBJS**, you can click on the **Share/Export** button, then choose either **Play** or **Auto** as the launch mode. ([Ref](https://qb64phoenix.com/forum/archive/index.php?thread-2095.html))

`main.bas` is meant to be used with the desktop build

`main_qbjs.bas` is the one that you should use instead
